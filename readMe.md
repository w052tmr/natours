# Natours Application

Built using modern technologies: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, PUG, and Google... lots and lots of Google.

This project was independently built following the Udemy course created by Jonas Schmedtmann titled "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2024".

I completed the course by watching the lectures, and then attempting to implement the code my own using my own knowledge as well as online documentation and resources. If I was unable to implement what I had learned independently by referencing online documentation, I would go back to the course videos as my last resort option.

After completing the course, I recoded the entire project from scratch to ensure I had a thorough grasp of all concepts I had learned from the course. Additionally, I independently added additional features not included in the course material including _signup_ and _password reset_ functionalities. This is the result from all the time and work I put in to doing that.

** Default course files included all the Pug files as well as the CSS file. However, the CSS file was missing media queries, so I added media queries to ensure the website would be responsive on different devices.

** The project was deployed using Vercel. Everything seems to work fine on larger devices, but I noticed some issues when using it on my iOS mobile device. I do not believe these issues have anything to do with my code, considering the application is only buggy on my iOS device and not on any of my other devices.
